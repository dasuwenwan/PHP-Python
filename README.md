# PHP-Python

#Main Purpose //
The first file I will upload later is a python file. It's a little program serve to create a house with some buttons like reset color and quit. Really fun to play with because you can click the house and change house color. Another highlight of this programmer is, you can see your mouse click coordinate if you click outside of the house. 

Update
I just uploaded a new file: graphics.py. This is a simple object-oriented graphics library designed to make it very easy
for novice programmers to experiment with computer graphics in an object-oriented fashion. 
I am currently working on a new game program called: Hanoi Towers. Everybody must play this when he was little. It's a huge project, I am planning to spend 2 weeks to finish this.

March 12, 2018 Update
Just upload the Hanoi Game part one. Being sick for two weeks, this is not fun....
