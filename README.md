# PHP-Python

Ah..
What should I write here?..

Oh right, the purpose.
I will upload some python and PHP files to here since I don't have any harddrives. Serious, is there anyone still using Harddrive??
I have lost 10+ harddrives in my life so far, yes, I do lost a lot of important files and photos. A littlt suggestion for harddrive companies: you should develop a new software that allow customers can track their devices. I mean even my litter puppy has a trackers which is only a tiny little chip under her skin, and that allow me to find where she is. I wouldn't mind to pay extra for this function because some people like me would appreciate this function.

The purpose of my code: Just for fun. Fair enought?

#Main Purpose //
The first file I will upload later is a python file. It's a little program serve to create a house with some buttons like reset color and quit. Really fun to play with because you can click the house and change house colour. Another highlight of this programer is, you can see your mouse click coordinate if you click outside of the house. 


Hope I can re-edit this file after, HEHE~
